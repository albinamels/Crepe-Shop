## Welcome to the [Responsive Restaurant Website](https://blinblin.netlify.app/) Design project! 
This project is a fully responsive website for my friend's small family business — a crepe shop — using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features real data and photos, providing a modern and interactive user experience. Designed to be compatible across all devices, the website ensures seamless navigation on both mobile and desktop platforms. The project is deployed via Netlify.

**Features:**
- Smooth Scrolling: Implemented smooth scrolling for seamless navigation through each section.
- Responsive Header: Designed a responsive header with a toggle menu effect using vanilla JavaScript, allowing easy navigation on mobile devices.
- Home, Menu, and Reviews Sections: Created responsive layouts with a touch slider using Swiper.js, enhancing the user experience with smooth transitions and interactivity.
- Order Form Section: Developed a fully responsive order form using CSS Flexbox for a clean and organized layout.
- Footer Section: Designed a responsive footer using CSS Grid, ensuring consistent structure across different screen sizes.
